Thanks for checking out Data science with Big Dillinger! I'm Frank (pseudonym Big Dillinger), an aspiring data scientist, part-time employee at [Uptake](http://uptake.com/) (a Chicago-based analytics company focused on Internet of Things applications) and full-time researcher at Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research. While the term _data science_ can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, I'll focus on what's been useful to me and what one can expect to find covered in a typical [introduction to machine learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) type of book. I will most likely stick with R and Python (perhaps leaning more heavily towards R), but this is not to say that the pursuit of _data science_ is limited within the scope of these two programming languages - shout outs to Javascript, Matlab, and Julia!

I will try to keep all relevant source code on my (personal) Github account:
{% include icon-github.html username="fineiskid" %}. If any code is missing from that account, I will provide the alternative link.

In addition to the code snippets and educational materials, please check out my blog for thought pieces regarding trends in data science and my space for Podcasts. Podcasts of all types are great! 

 <br /> 


Yours truly,  <br /> 
Frank
