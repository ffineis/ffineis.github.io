### Welcome!

While the definition of "Data Science" may still remain elusive, I hope to share my thoughts on the subject, code, and progress in exploring the field with you here. I'm Frank Fineis (on twitter, Big Dillinger), a former Data Scientist at industrial internet of things analytics firm [Uptake](https://uptake.com/) turned statistics PhD student at Northwestern University ([I'm real!](http://www.statistics.northwestern.edu/people/graduate-students/)). 

![me](/images/ffineis_headshot.png){: .image-right } At Uptake, I worked on real-time anomaly detection models, time series smoothing, building time-to-failure models, and data pipelining/full-stack development via Postgres, [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow), and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Research is absolutely something I'm new to, and I expect the next 5 years to be full of ups and downs - hopefully this makes for some interesting blog posts and code tutorials. My current interests are time series analysis, time-to-event modeling, and natural language processing, although all of this is subject to change.

I keep the code I'm allowed to work on openly on Github ({% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %}). My thoughts and opinions are none other than my own and are in no way reflective of any employer or Northwestern University.
