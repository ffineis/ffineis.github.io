### Welcome!


<img align="right" src="/images/ffineis_headshot.png"> While the definition of "Data Science" may still remain elusive, I hope to share my thoughts on the subject, code, and progress in exploring the field with you here. I'm Frank Fineis (on twitter, Big Dillinger). I used to work as a Data Scientist Lead at industrial internet of things analytics firm [Uptake](https://uptake.com/). In late 2017 I started a PhD in [statistics](http://www.statistics.northwestern.edu/people/graduate-students/) at Northwestern University where I'm focused on statistical machine learning methodology and building bioinformatics pipelines with R and Python, and where I TA the Department of Statistics' Data Science course sequence.

At Uptake, I worked on real-time anomaly detection models, time series smoothing, building time-to-failure models, and data pipelining/full-stack web application development via Postgres, [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow), and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Research is absolutely something I'm new to, and I expect the next 5 years to be full of ups and downs - hopefully this makes for some interesting blog posts and code tutorials. My current interests are time series analysis, time-to-event modeling, and natural language processing, although all of this is subject to change.

Check out my Github ({% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %}) for code I've authored, projects I'm working on. My thoughts and opinions are none other than my own and are in no way reflective of any employer or Northwestern University (my employer, although they might hesitate to consider themselves as such).
