<p><em>Predictive analytics</em>, <em>deep learning</em>, <em>big data</em>: they’re all buzzwords that surround this term we’ve settled on called <em>data science</em>. Data science has been called the crossroads of traditional computer science, statistics, and computer programming. To me, data science too often gets funneled into a simple application of a machine learning technique for binary classification purposes. If that means nothing to you, it just means classifying objects as a 0 (negative response) or 1 (positive response). That said, binary classification tasks are a huge facet of predictive modeling! Data science can encompass everything from a simple linear regression model, to computer vision, linguistic analysis, database structure, and even <a href="http://www.anishathalye.com/2015/12/19/an-ai-that-can-mimic-any-artist/">Van Gogh</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>, art is quantifiable according to convolutional neural networks.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>data science</em> is exactly what it sounds like - experimenting and trying to draw conclusions from datasets. While there are hundreds, if not thousands of different specific fields contained within data science such as regression modeling, predictive modeling, high-performance computing cluster management, neural nets (don’t get me started on neural nets), I guarantee that there is a huge body of literature and guides for the flavor of data science you’re interested in. My goals for the aspiring data scientist - have fun, be creative, experiment, and try to learn Git! Data scientists these days (data science as we know it really emerged hundreds of years ago with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary#Need_for_insurance">rise of amateur actuaries</a>) all will mostly have a foundation in R and/or Python, basic statistical/probability knowledge, and from there they will try to specialize in particular fields most interesting or useful to them.</p>
